# CNN Model for Parkinson Disease Detection
 A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for Parkinson's Disease detection is a deep learning architecture designed to analyze medical data, typically in the form of images, to identify and diagnose Parkinson's Disease. 


# Project Overview:
In this project a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that leverages the power of deep learning and image analysis to detect Parkinson's disease from hand-drawn spiral and wave images is developed.
